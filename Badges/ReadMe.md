## Reasoning   

The idea of a maker passport is a proposed solution to different recurring issues in the maker community:   
-What/who is a maker?   
-How can one prove he is a maker?   
-Is “maker” a profession, if not, how can it eventually become one?   
-On what basis, can a maker then be trusted for hire or association on a sensible project?   

A normal passport functions both as an identification document, but also keeps track of the mobility of the holder. We will be adding to those functionalities, a record of the skills possessed by the maker and the makerspaces, FabLab, events where they were acquired.

### How will it work?   

The passport has two elements:   

-A physical booklet like a regular passport, with an RFID chip.
Like a club membership card it is easy to carry, and can be personalized be its owner or the issuing entity. The RFID chip will be programmed to interface with the digital side of the passport, and in some cases act as an access key to locations and equipment. 
-A badging system, based on the Openbadges model.
There will be physical badges as stickers, but the most important part is the digital badge. 


A discussion should be held on how the attribution of badges should be carried out, and what standards should be used.
It is safe to assume that the higher the standards the better for the community as a whole, but too high standards might be a turnoff.   

We will be classifying skills in these sets:
##### Practical skills.
We will be referring to skills requiring some tutoring and practice to master.
##### Soft skills.
These are harder to define; we will be referring to more abstract/subjective skills such as leadership, organizational competence, public speaking etc.   

Upon contacting different parties, we came to realize, we were facing some version of the Byzantine General Dilemma.
Three variables are at play:   
-The issuer.   
The person or organization attributing a badge vetting for a skill.
The issuers want an in-person assessment of some skills, especially skills requiring practice (i.e. machine usage, maintenance etc.). There is also the question of the personality of the recipient. In regards to how he/she behaved during the assessment, soft skill can be noted in those instances. Given the cost of the equipment found in makerspaces (some worth over 10000€), and security issues (fire hazards are all over makerspaces), the badge should be a real trustworthy guaranty. 

-The recipient.   
The individual whose skill is assessed and sanctioned by a badge.
The recipients want to be able to move from one facility to another, and not be required to reassess their skills each time they visit a new makerspace. At the same time, they want to be able to assess their skills in any facility of their choosing while retaining the same quality / value of assessment. This facilitates collaboration between different communities and allows great mobility within the maker movement as a whole.

-The badge.   
A token certifying to the community that the recipient possesses a given skill. 
The digital element of the badge should have a protocol guaranteeing its authenticity. It should not just be a copy/paste file, but be traceable back to the issuer. Each issuer would have a database of all skills available within his node. This data can appeal to policy makers, and help in funding projects.   


How do we insure that all three variables are truthful?
Do we create a blockchain type system, where the passport is the wallet? 
That would be ideal, but then, how do we manage the badge generation? We can’t go mining them as bitcoins, skills have each, different requirements to be acquired.   

The proposed solution to explore is to badge practical skills upon completion of tutorials, and soft skills, which are more subjective, could be badge based on documented events/projects.
