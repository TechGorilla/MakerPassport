# Tutorials

### Description
This is the collection of tutorials used to assess the skills warranting a badge.
Some skills might be attributed for special occasions or online by third party websites, those will also be referenced here.   
There was also an idea of using the [Fab Academy' tutorials](https://github.com/Academany/FabAcademy-Tutorials). That should be discussed with the organization if that is the path chosen.
